# Prototype Lua Object-Oriented Program System

**PLoop** is an object-oriented program system for the Lua.

It's built on a prototype system which is used to easy the using of the Lua meta-table system.


## Prototypes

Based on the prototype system, the **PLoop** provided several prototypes:

* The **environment** prototype provide the common environmental controls for code management and type building.

* The **attribute** prototype provide the functional description labels for the codes like function, class, object and etc.

* The **namespace** prototype provide a namespace system to manage and provide quick acessing of types.

* The **enum** prototype provide the enumeration validation data types.

* The **struct** prototype provide the structure validation data types.

* The **interface** prototype provided the interface system, interfaces are abstracts of functions, also are the multiple inheritance system provided by the **PLoop**.

* The **class** prototype provided the class system, the classes are abstracts of the objects, it provide method, meta-method, features(see below) to the objects.

* The **property** prototype provided the property features to the class objects.

* The **event** prototype provided the event features to the class objects.


## PLoop

When load the **PLoop**, we can use the variable *PLoop* to access features defined in it or use it to process the codes.

It's also returned by the `require "PLoop"`. So for a simple example:

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
	print(XList(100):Sum())  -- Sum 1 to 100
end)
```

The PLoop is the root namespace of all others. It's an anonymous namespace, we can only access it by the *PLoop* variable. Normally we only need use it when use **PLoop**'s features in the `_G`.

The above example can be converted to

```lua
require "PLoop"

-- Use PLoop to access its sub namespaces
print(PLoop.System.Collections.XList(100):Sum())
```


## The validatable data types

The types generated by the **enum**, **struct**, **interface** and **class** are all validatable data types.

The validatable data types can be used in any place that need value validation like struct member field, property type, argument type and etc:

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
	-- String is a struct type
	class "Person" { Name = String }

	o = Person()

	-- Error:  the Name must be string, got number
	o.Name = 123
end)
```

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
	__Arguments__{ String, Number }
	function SetInfo(name, age)
	end

	-- Error: Usage: SetInfo(System.String, System.Number) - the 2nd argument must be number, got boolean
	SetInfo("Ann", true)
end)
```

To be a validatable data type, its prototype must provide a methods:

* ValidateValue(type, value[, onlyValid])   - validate the value with the type
	* Params:
		* type      - the validatable data type
		* value     - the value to be validated
		* onlyValid - only validate the value if true, won't modify the value
	* Return:
		* value     - nil if not pass, the value may be changed during the validation
		* message   - the error message if the value failed the valiation, it's better to return true instead of the message if the onlyValid is true


The prototype may provide several methods(if provided must follow the rule):

* GetDefault(type)  - Gets the default value of the type
	* Params:
		* type      - the target type
	* Return:
		* default   - the default value of the type


* IsSubType(type, supertype)    - Whether the type is a sub type of the super type
	* Params:
		* type      - the target type
		* supertype - the super type
	* Return:
		* issubtype - true if the type is a sub type of the super type

* IsImmutable(type) - whether the value of the type is immutable, so the value won't be changed when pass through the validation
	* Params:
		* type      - the target type
	* Return:
		* immutable - true if the value of the type is immutable

* IsSealed(type)    - whether the type is sealed and can't be re-defined
	* Params:
		* type      - the target type
	* Return:
		* sealed    - true if the type is sealed

All validatable data type prototypes must provide the **ValidateValue** method. Only **enum** and **struct** has **GetDefault**. All **enum**, **interface** and **class** types are immutable, the **struct** type is immutable only if it has no initializer. We'll learn more in their topics.


## PLOOP_PLATFORM_SETTINGS

Before loading the **PLoop** lib, we can make a table named **PLOOP_PLATFORM_SETTINGS**, the table contains several settings can be modified based on the target platform and frameworks. Its fields are all optional.

We'll learn more in the next chapters.

* ATTR_USE_WARN_INSTEAD_ERROR           - Whether the attribute system use warning instead of error for invalid attribute target type. Default false

* ENV_ALLOW_GLOBAL_VAR_BE_NIL           - Whether the environmet allow global variable be nil, if false, things like ture(spell error) could trigger error. Default true

* GLOBAL_VARIABLE_FILTER                - The filter function used to validation the new declared global variables with key and value, if the function return non-false value, that means the assignment is not legal(if we write the code `idx = 1` in a function, we normally missed the `local`), so the assignment should be canceled or warned, you also can use the filter to record the global assignments

* GLOBAL_VARIABLE_FILTER_USE_WARN       - Whether use warning instead of the error, if use warning, the assignment will still be processed

* GLOBAL_VARIABLE_FILTER_GET_CALLLINE   - Whether pass the callline of the global assignment to the filter

* TYPE_DEFINITION_WITH_OLD_STYLE        - Whether allow old style of type definitions like : class "A"  endclass "A". Default false

* TYPE_VALIDATION_DISABLED              - Whether the type validation should be disabled. The value should be false during development, toggling it to true will make the system ignore the value valiation in several conditions for speed. Default false

* NAMESPACE_NIL_VALUE_ACCESSIBLE 		- Whether allow accessing non-existent value from namespace, if true access features like 'System.Nonexist' will return nil value, otherwise an error will be raised. Default true

* CLASS_NO_MULTI_VERSION_CLASS          - Whether all old objects keep using new features when their classes or extend interfaces are re-defined. Default false

* CLASS_NO_SUPER_OBJECT_STYLE           - Whether all interfaces & classes only use the classic format `super.Method(obj, ...)` to call super's features, don't use newstyle like : `super[obj].Name = "Ann"`, `super[obj].OnNameChanged = super[obj].OnNameChanged + print`, `super[obj]:Greet("King")`. Default false

* INTERFACE_ALL_ANONYMOUS_CLASS         - Whether all interfaces has anonymous class, so it can be used to generate object. Default false

* OBJECT_NO_RAWSEST                     - Whether all class objects can't save value to fields directly, So only init fields, properties, events can be set during runtime. Default false

* OBJECT_NO_NIL_ACCESS                  - Whether all class objects can't fetch nil value from it, combine it with **OBJ_NO_RAWSEST** will force a strict mode for development. Default false

* OBJECT_DEBUG_SOURCE                   - Whether save the creation places (source and line) for all objects. Default false

* CORE_LOG_LEVEL                        - The Log level used in the Prototype core part., 1(Trace), 2(Debug), 3(Info), 4(Warn), 5(Error), 6(Fatal). Default 3(Info)

* CORE_LOG_HANDLER                      - The core log handler works like : function CORE_LOG_HANDLER(message, loglevel) end.  Default print

* MULTI_OS_THREAD                       - Whether the system is used in a platform where multi os threads share one lua-state, so the access conflict can't be ignore. Default false

* MULTI_OS_THREAD_LUA_LOCK_APPLIED      - Whether the system is used in a platform where multi os threads share one lua-state, and the lua_lock and lua_unlock apis are applied, so PLoop don't need to care about the thread conflict. Default false

* MULTI_OS_THREAD_ENV_AUTO_CACHE_WARN   - Whether the system send warning messages when the system is used in a platform where multi os threads share one lua-state, and global variables are saved not to the environment but an inner cache, it'd solve the thread conflict, but the environment need fetch them by `__index` meta-call, so it's better to declare local variables to hold them for best access speed. Default true

* UNSAFE_MODE                           - Whether the system use tables for the types of namespace, class and others, and save the type's meta data in themselves. Normally it's not recommended. Default false

* EXCEPTION_SAVE_STACK_DATA             - Whether try to save the stack data into the exception object, so we can have more details about the exception. Default true

* THREAD_POOL_MAX_SIZE                  - The max pool size of the thread pool. Default 40

* USE_DISPOSE_AS_META_GC 				-- Use the Dispose as the `__gc`, only works for Lua 5.3 and above. Default true


### Recommend Settings - Development

With several settings, the **PLoop** could help the developers to quickly locate spell and type errors.

```lua
PLOOP_PLATFORM_SETTINGS 			= {
    OBJECT_NO_RAWSEST 				= true,
    OBJECT_NO_NIL_ACCESS 			= true,
    TYPE_VALIDATION_DISABLED 		= false,
    ENV_ALLOW_GLOBAL_VAR_BE_NIL 	= false,
    NAMESPACE_NIL_VALUE_ACCESSIBLE 	= false,
}

require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
	class "Person" { Name = String, Age = Number }

	ann = Person{ Name = "Ann", Age = 12 }

	ann.name = "Lucy" 		-- Forbidden by OBJECT_NO_NIL_ACCESS for non-existed property/event 'name'
	ann.Age = ann.age + 1  	-- Forbidden by OBJECT_NO_RAWSEST for non-existed property/event 'age'

	__Arguments__{ Number }
	function test(id) end

	test("hi") 				-- Forbidden by TYPE_VALIDATION_DISABLED(false) for not pass the argument check

	print(ture) 			-- Forbidden by ENV_ALLOW_GLOBAL_VAR_BE_NIL(false) for non-existed global variable

	print(System.Xyz) 		-- Forbidden by NAMESPACE_NIL_VALUE_ACCESSIBLE(false) for non-existed namespace
end)
```

### Recommend Settings - Release

Although those checking features are very useful during the development, but they also give the system a tiny performance loss. To gain more performance, it's better to turn them off for the release build:

```lua
PLOOP_PLATFORM_SETTINGS 			= {
    OBJECT_NO_RAWSEST 				= false,
    OBJECT_NO_NIL_ACCESS 			= false,
    TYPE_VALIDATION_DISABLED 		= true,
    ENV_ALLOW_GLOBAL_VAR_BE_NIL 	= true,
    NAMESPACE_NIL_VALUE_ACCESSIBLE 	= true,
}
```
